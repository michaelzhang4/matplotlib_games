## Games made in Matplotlib ##

1. Minesweeper - classic game, right click to flag, left click to mine

2. Set - game where you match 3 cards that for each of (color, number, shading, shape) are all different or all the same.

Just run the python files to play, only requirements are matplotlib and numpy libraries.
